# What is ShardingSphere Benchmark
ShardingSphere Benchmark is a performance tool to check its benchmark of core scenarios which are in figure below. The amount of benchmark cases is 96, the formula is 3(Scenarios) * 4(Products) * 2(SQL Type) * 4(Rules).


|       *Scenarios*       |  *Products*           |      *SQL TYPE*        | *Rules*  | 
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Full Route              |  ShardingSphere-JDBC  |  Select                |   Encrypt                | 
| Range Route             |  ShardingSphere-Proxy |  Insert/Update/Delete  |   Master-Slave           |  
| Single Route            |  MYSQL                |                        |   Sharding               | 
|                         |                       |                        |   Sharding-Master-Slave-Encrypt   | 

## How to work
ShardingSphere Benchmark is mainly achieved by JMeter in summary, running as command *jmeter -n -t testplan*.

### Environment Preparation

```bash
mvn clean install
```

#### Install ShardingSphere-Proxy
* Get source code of ShardingSphere from [ShardingSphere Source Code URL](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere), the features for different branches refer to [ShardingSphere Doc](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/).
* Get ShardingSphere-Proxy installation by running command below. For ShardingSphere 4.x, it's located at *{project_base_dir}/sharding-distribution/sharding-proxy-distribution/target*; for ShardingSphere 5.x, it's located at *{project_base_dir}/shardingsphere-distribution/shardingsphere-proxy-distribution/target*.
```bash
mvn clean install -Prelease
```
* Decompress ShardingSphere-proxy above, leave the JDBC jar and ShardingSphere Benchmark jar into *{ShardingSphere-Proxy_base_dir}/lib/*.


#### Install JMeter

* Install and set up JMeter according to [JMeter doc](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html).
* Leave ShardingSphere Benchmark jar into *{JMeter_base_dir}/lib/ext*.


#### Configuration
We have extracted necessary user configuration which is in *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/config/user-config.properties*. You have to change configuration list below as yours. By default we configure any ip with host in the code or yaml to prevent ip leakage and cause security problemsã€‚ We provide the unified host configuration at *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/config/shardingsphere_benchmark_machline_hosts*, modify ips as yours and replace the host file. There is no need to change those ips if running benchmark at local machine.

```bash
// It is base directory of ShardingSphere project.
shardingsphere.project.base.path=/export/jenkins/workspace/ShardingSphere-Benchmark-Deploy
// It is base directory of ShardingSphere benchmark project.
shardingsphere.benchmark.project.base.path=/export/benchmark/shardingsphere-benchmark
// It is base directory of ShardingSphere benchmark result.
shardingsphere.benchmark.result.base.path=/export/shardingsphere-benchmark/result
// It is database port of ShardingSphere benchmark result accessing.
shardingsphere.benchmark.result.database.port=3306
// It is database username of ShardingSphere benchmark result using.
shardingsphere.benchmark.result.database.username=root
// It is database password of ShardingSphere benchmark result, we can leave it empty by default.
shardingsphere.benchmark.result.database.password=
// It is host or ip list of ShardingSphere benchmark using.
shardingsphere.benchmark.database.machine.host.list=ss.benchmark.fullrouting.encrypt.ds0;ss.benchmark.fullrouting.encrypt.ds1;ss.benchmark.fullrouting.encrypt.ds2
// It is database host of ShardingSphere benchmark result using. Statistics of ShardingSphere benchmark will be stored into the database. 
shardingsphere.benchmark.result.database.host=ss.benchmark.result
```

#### Init Database/Table
We have to prepare database and table for benchmark. They are configured at *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/config/user-config.properties*, run the command below to create physical databases and tables.
```bash
jmeter -n -t {ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/testplan/common/initdb/initdb-testplan.jmx
```

#### Init Base Data
All of initing base data test plans for different scenarios are at *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/testplan/common/datapreparation*. Here is a command for instance, which scenario to test in final depends on your choice.  
```bash
jmeter -n -t {ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/testplan/common/datapreparation/shardingsphere/sharding/shardingsphere-sharding-createdata-testplan.jmx
```

#### Run a Test Plan
All of test plans for different scenarios are at *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/testplan/*. Here is a command for instance, which scenario to test in final depends on your choice.  
```bash
jmeter -n -t {ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/testplan/singlerouting/encrypt/shardingjdbc-singlerouting-encrypt-select-testplan.jmx
```

After running the command successfully, it generates a JMeter result file located at *shardingsphere.benchmark.result.base.path* which is configured in *{ShardingSphere Benchmark base dir}/src/main/resources/config/user-config.properties*. The JMeter result looks like the figure below.
```bash
timeStamp,elapsed,label,responseCode,responseMessage,threadName,dataType,success,failureMessage,bytes,sentBytes,grpThreads,allThreads,Latency,IdleTime,Connect
1598274390236,8657,JMeterShardingJDBCFullRoutingEncryptSelect,,,Thread Group 1-74,,true,,0,0,100,100,0,0,0

1598274390236,8878,JMeterShardingJDBCFullRoutingEncryptSelect,,,Thread Group 1-42,,true,,0,0,100,100,0,0,0
1598274390234,8917,JMeterShardingJDBCFullRoutingEncryptSelect,,,Thread Group 1-15,,true,,0,0,100,100,0,0,0
1598274390234,9002,JMeterShardingJDBCFullRoutingEncryptSelect,,,Thread Group 1-3,,true,,0,0,100,100,0,0,0
```

#### Statistics
We could calculate the general statistics by JMeter result such as TPS. There are two physical tables to store the statistics, *benchmark_result* and *benchmark_avg_result*. You could query the result from the databases directly as well if you prefer. Trigger the sql below to get latest record for the test.

* Physical table *benchmark_result*: intermediate result will be here, its table structure is below.

```

```bash
select * from benchmark_result order by id limit 1
